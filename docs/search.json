He graduated from Humboldt State University in 2014 where he studied history, mathematics, and scientific diving. Cullen enjoys outdoor activities such as mountain biking, camping, and freediving. He is currently a master’s candidate of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. Cullen worked five seasons with Channel Islands National Park’s Kelp Forest Monitoring Program where he developed his skills in subtidal field methods, data collection, data quality control, and database management. Cullen is interested in how ecological communities change in response to environmental stressors such as climate patterns, fishing pressure, and disease events. He aspires to continue working in marine ecology with his expanded data processing, modeling, and presentation skills that he will apply towards improving our understanding of these complex ecosystems. His goal is to produce products that effectively synthesize long term datasets to understand the processes which drive kelp forest communities, and ultimately share this understanding with the scientific community and the broader public.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education\r\n            Masters of Environmental Data Science\r\n            Bren School of Environmental Science & Management - Santa Barbara, California (2022)\r\n            MEDS Recruitment Fellowship\r\n            Advanced Technology Grant\r\n            Capstone Project Selection Committee\r\n            Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)\r\n            Humboldt State University - Arcata, California (2014)\r\n            Major in History\r\n            Minors in Mathematics and Scientific Diving\r\n            Certificate in Marine Technology\r\n            Santa Barbara City College - Santa Barbara, California (2018)\r\n            Commercial Diver Certifications\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Experience\r\n            Biological Science Technician - Kelp Forest Monitoring Program\r\n            Channel Islands National Park - Ventura, California\r\n            5 Seasons (2017-2021)\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Cullen Molitor\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      KFM App\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Bren Profile\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              Biography\r\n              Cullen is a marine ecologist with expertise in long term monitoring of kelp forest environments in California.
