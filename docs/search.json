I graduated from Humboldt State\r\nUniversity in 2014 where I studied history, mathematics, and scientific\r\ndiving. I enjoys outdoor activities such as mountain biking, camping,\r\nand freediving. I am currently a master’s candidate of Environmental\r\nData Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management\r\nat UC Santa Barbara. I have worked five seasons with Channel Islands\r\nNational Park’s Kelp Forest Monitoring Program where I developed my\r\nskills in subtidal field methods, data collection, data quality control,\r\nand database management. I am interested in how ecological communities\r\nchange in response to environmental stressors such as climate patterns,\r\nfishing pressure, and disease events. I aspire to continue working in\r\nmarine ecology with expanded data processing, modeling, and presentation\r\nskills tp apply towards improving our understanding of these complex\r\necosystems. My goal is to produce products that effectively synthesize\r\nlong term datasets to understand the processes which drive kelp forest\r\ncommunities, and ultimately share this understanding with the scientific\r\ncommunity and the broader public.\r\n\r\nDiving the wreck of the Yukon off the coast of San Diego\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\nPreparing to dive heavy gear at Santa Barbara City\r\nCollege\r\n\r\nDiving heavy gear at Santa Barbara City College\r\n\r\nDiving Southeast Reef, Santa Barbara Island\r\n\r\nDiving Southeast Reef, Santa Barbara Island\r\n\r\nDiving Southeast Reef, Santa Barbara Island\r\n\r\nPreparing to dive surface supplied air at Cathedral Cove, Anacapa\r\nIsland\r\n\r\nPreparing to dive surface supplied air at Cathedral Cove, Anacapa\r\nIsland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
